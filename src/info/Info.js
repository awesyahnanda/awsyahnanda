    bio: `Hello there! I'm Syah. an aspiring Data Analyst and Scientist from Jakarta,Indonesia. Specializing in Python, SQL, Tableau and other analytical tools. I was working professionally in sustainability and engineering field for about almost 3 years, and turn out realigning my career path to actively mastering data science and analytics at Purwadhika Digital Technology School. I couldn't be happier to drive transformational solutions by data-driven across various industries. <br /><br /> I'm currently developing on learning data analytics, science and Machine Learning Models. Once I feel I've become fairly proficient in my preferred stack, I plan to expand my horizons to NLP, Gerative-AI, and eventually I'll probably end up giving into the Data & Product Craze. I enjoy coffee talks, and I believe data will inevitably bring us all in perfection.`,
